== Tiger User interfaces

[#_admin_ui]
=== Admin UI

The Tiger Admin UI is a separate module that can be downloaded from maven

https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/de/gematik/test/tiger-admin

Choose a current version and download the `tiger-admin-x.y.z.jar` to a local folder on your computer.

Run the following command to get the Tiger Admin UI up and running:

[source,shell script]
----
java -jar tiger-admin-x.y.z.jar --server.port=8080
----

Now open your firefox browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8080.

Voila you are ready to start working with the Tiger Admin UI


=== Workflow UI

The Workflow UI is currently an experimental feature implemented as PoC.
We plan to have this feature in product grade quality in the first half of 2022.
Till then there is not much more than in the <<tigerTestLibrary.adoc#_workflow_ui>> section above.

=== Standalone Tiger Proxy UI

To watch the recorded messages and to be able to analyze issues at test run time already you can visit the Tiger Proxy web user interface at:

[source,http request]
----
http://127.0.0.1:${SERVERPORT}/webui
----

With `SERVERPORT` being the configured server port of the Tiger Proxy.
