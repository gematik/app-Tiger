== Tiger Configuration

Configuration is an integral part of testing. To make this task easier for you and to make configuration the various parts of the system as easy as possible Tiger has a central configuration store: TigerGlobalConfiguration. It combines properties from multiple source and feeds into various parts of the system.

image::media/tiger-configuration-global.svg[title="The TigerGlobalConfiguration with inlets and outlets"]

This allows a vastly simplified retrieval and configuration of nearly all aspects of the system. It is therefore recommended reusing this system for your own testsuite as well.

[#_inlets]
=== Inlets

The following inlets are considered in the TigerGlobalConfiguration (ordered from most to least important, meaning if a property occurs in multiple sources the one at the top is considered first):

* Exports from ScopedExecutor
* Thread-local exports
* Exports done in glue code
* Exports during runtime (`TigerGlobalConfiguration.putValue()`)
* Command-line properties
* System-Properties (System.setProperty)
* Environment-Variables (export "FOO_BAR" = 42)
* Full-text YAML file (value of `tiger.yaml` configuration key)
* Additional YAML-Files (`additionalYamls:`)
* Host YAML-File (`tiger-<hostname>.yaml`)
* Main YAML-File (`tiger.yaml`)
* Interne Defaults

=== Key-translation

To easily convert between the multiple sources the TigerGlobalConfiguration offers key-translation:

`tiger.foo.bar` is equal to `TIGER_FOO_BAR` is equal to `tIgER.fOO.BaR`

* When the key consists only of letters and underscores then the underscores are converted to points.
* Names are compared without considering the case.

=== Thread-based configuration

To enable execution of multiple tests simultaneously some data has to be stored in a thread-based manner (the first step could for example store the result of a request in a variable, the second step could read it from that variable).

To enable this simply reference the Thread-context when storing a variable:

[source,java]
----
TigerGlobalConfiguration.putValue("foo.value", "bar", SourceType.THREAD_CONTEXT);
----

When retrieving the variable you could simply ask for `foo.value`: Only when you are in the thread that stored this variable you will find it again.

=== Placeholders

The TigerGlobalConfiguration supports the use of placeholders. Say for example you have a test-environment with two servers, "A" and "B". For the server "A" you have two choices: Either a real URL in the internet or a locally booted server. The use can choose which to activate by setting "active" of the server to use. The server "B" should now use the activated server, without having to set it manually while booting.

You could achieve this by exporting the URL (`servers.myServer.exports`) and referencing it in an argument which is passed into server "B" (`serverAUrl=${serverA.url}`. The first part here before the equal is the name of the environment variable passed into server "B" while booting, the second part behind the equal is the name of the property. compare this to the exports in the two serverA-options):

[source,YAML,title="Configuring using placeholders and exports"]
----
servers:
  serverAInternet:
    active: true
    type: externalUrl
    source:
      - https://my.real.server/api
    exports:
# The string SERVERA_URL is split internally into SERVERA and URL, which are then considered
# as lowercase keys
      - SERVERA_URL=https://my.real.server/api
  serverALocal:
    active: false
    type: externalUrl
    source:
      - https://localhost:8080/api
    exports:
      - SERVERA_URL=https://localhost:8080/api
  serverB:
    type: externalJar
    source:
      - http://nexus/download/server.jar
    healthcheckUrl: http://127.0.0.1:19307
    externalJarOptions:
      arguments:
# The second part is the placeholder which will be resolved using the internal value store.
# The string "serverA.url" is split into "serverA" and "url", again considered as lowercase,
# which then matches to "SERVERA_URL",
        - --serverAUrl=${serverA.url}
----

WARNING: Placeholders which can not be resolved will not lead to errors but rather they will simply not be replaced.

=== Localized configuration

Sometimes scope-creep can be a concern: Say you want to add a bunch of values right for one specific call but want to avoid that those values can be seen from everywhere else. By default, TigerGlobalConfiguration does not honor scope, which is a deliberate design-choice. To give you greater control over scope-behavior use the `.localScope()`-method:

[source,java]
----
TigerGlobalConfiguration.localScope()
    .withValue("local.key", "localValue")
    .withValue("another.key", "anotherValue")
    .execute(() -> assertThat(TigerGlobalConfiguration.readString("local.key"))
        .isEqualTo("localValue"));
----

Bear in mind that this does not work with threading: The values are added to the global store and will remain in the store for the duration of the execution of the given runnable. If you execute multiple tests in parallel you should look into the `TigerThreadScopedConfigurationSource` (which comes with other drawbacks, threading is not an easy problem to solve).

=== Examples

Some examples to clarify:

==== Example 1

Say you have an environment configured in your testenv.yaml. You want the Tiger Proxy to forward traffic on one route to your backend-server. This will normally be a local server, but on the build-server you want to address another host. You can simply set an environment variable to do the job for you. Below are the relevant snippets:

[source,YAML,title="tiger.yaml with the Tiger Proxy routing everything to the local server"]
----
tigerProxy:
    proxyRoutes:
        - from: /
          to: http://127.0.0.1:8080
----

In the buildserver you can now simply overwrite the "to"-part of this route like so:

[source,bash]
----
export TIGERPROXY_PROXYROUTES_0_TO = "http://real.server"
----

==== Example 2

In the above example let's say you only want to customize the port. This can be done by using placeholders:

[source,YAML,title="tiger.yaml with the Tiger Proxy routing everything to the local server"]
----
tigerProxy:
    proxyRoutes:
        - from: /
          to: http://127.0.0.1:${backend.server.port}
----

This time we don't overwrite the complete to-url but only the port like so:

[source,bash]
----
export BACKEND_SERVER_PORT = "8080"
----

==== Example 3

Now we want to assert that the reply coming from the server has the correct backend-url in the XML that is returned to the sender.
To do this we have to reference the configured URL from above, since the value could be different on every execution.
We can solve this using placeholders:

[source,Gherkin,title="The testsuite"]
----
    TGR current response with attribute "$.body.ReplyStructure.Header.Sender.url" matches "http://127.0.0.1:${backend.server.port}"
----

The glue-code in Tiger automatically resolves the placeholders.

=== Pre-Defined values

Tiger adds some pre-defined values to make your life easier configuring the environment.
Currently these are:

* `free.port.0` - `free.port.255`: Free ports that are randomly determined at startup but stay fixed during the execution.
This enables side effect free execution of the testsuite.

//TODO when screenplay: Please use Serenity-BDD-Screenplay Actor (to avoid thread-pooled misshaps)

=== Inline JEXL

In addition to the `${foo.bar}` syntax allowing the retrieval of configuration values there exists the `!{'foo' != 'bar'}` syntax allowing the execution of JEXL expressions.
The JEXL-syntax is described in more depth here: https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/reference/syntax.html

To give you more power and flexibility when creating inline-JEXL-expression you can access several namespaces from inside the JEXL expression.
You will find two predefined namespaces and also the ability to add your own, allowing further customization.

==== The default namespace

The default-namespace of the inline JEXL-expression carries the following functions:

* `file(<filename>)` loads the given file and returns it as a UTF-8 parsed string.
* `sha256` returns the HEX-encoded SHA256-value of the given string.
* `sha256Base64` returns the Base64-encoded SHA256-value of the given string.
* `sha512` returns the HEX-encoded SHA512-value of the given string.
* `sha512Base64` returns the Base64-encoded SHA512-value of the given string.
* `md5` returns the HEX-encoded MD5-value of the given string.
* `md5Base64` returns the Base64-encoded MD5-value of the given string.
* `base64Encode` returns the Base64-Encoding of the given string (non-url safe).
* `base64UrlEncode` returns the Base64-URL-Encoding of the given string.
* `base64Decode` decodes the given Base64-String (URL and non-url) and converts it into a UTF-8 string.

An example of a function-invocation in the default namespace:

```
!{file('src/test/resources/testMessage.json')}
```

This will load the given file and replace any placeholders found in it.

==== The rbel namespace

To give you direct access to the messages sent please use the rbel-namespace:

* `currentResponse` returns the current response, optionally filtered by a given Rbel-path
* `currentResponseAsString` returns the string-representation of the current response, optionally filtered by a given Rbel-path
* `currentRequest` returns the current request, optionally filtered by a given Rbel-path
* `currentRequestAsString` returns the string-representation of the current request, optionally filtered by a given Rbel-path

This can be done like so

```
!{rbel:currentResponseAsString('$.body.html.head.link.href')}
```

This will immediately return the `href`-attribute of the link in question as a string.

==== Adding custom namespaces

You can easily register additional namespaces by calling `TigerJexlExecutor.registerAdditionalNamespace(<namespace-prefix>, <namespace class or object)`.


=== Configuration Editor

The configuration editor allows to view and edit the tiger configuration during a test run. The editor is part of the xref:tigerTestLibrary.adoc#_workflow_ui[Workflow UI] and can be opened by clicking the gears icon in the sidebar (xref:editor_start_button[xrefstyle=short]).

image::media/configuration_editor_start_button.png[id="editor_start_button",alt="workflow UI with action buttons and gears icon highlighted", title="Open the configuration editor by clicking the gears icon in the sidebar.", align="center"]

The configuration editor displays a table where you can view the current configuration properties loaded in the Tiger global configuration (xref:editor_table[xrefstyle=short]). This includes properties from all xref:_inlets[inlet sources]. If a property is defined multiple times in different sources, only the one with higher importance is displayed.

image::media/configuration_editor_table.png[id="editor_table", alt="view of the configuration editor table showing several properties", title="The Tiger global configuration editor"]

The editor allows sorting and filtering each column so that you can easily find a specific property (xref:editor_column_filter[xrefstyle=short]). Given that the Tiger global configuration includes many environment variables and system properties which are not directly relevant to Tiger, the filtering functionally proves to be especially useful.

image::media/configuration_editor_example_filter_popup.png[id="editor_column_filter", alt="screenshot of Key column displaying a filter popup filtering by the word tiger",title="Example of filtering the column key by the text 'tiger'"]

The values of existing configuration properties can be edited by double-clicking the value cells. This opens an input field where you can input a new value (xref:cell_editor[xrefstyle=short]).

image::media/configuration_editor_cell_editor_example.png[id="cell_editor", alt="cell editor popup showing how to edit a property value", title="Double clicking a value cell opens the cell editor."]

Additionally, you can remove existing configuration properties by clicking the delete button (xref:delete_button[xrefstyle=short])

image::media/configuration_editor_delete_button.png[id="delete_button", alt="screenshot of editor table highlighting the delete button", title="Clicking the delete button removes the property from the Tiger global configuration."]

TIP: Editing or removing configuration properties will not affect already ran tests. If you want to use edited properties in a specific test, then you should pause the test before editing the configuration. In xref:_workflow_ui[Workflow UI] you can see how to use custom steps to pause the test suite.
