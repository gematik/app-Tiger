== Tiger User interfaces

=== Workflow UI

The Workflow UI is a new feature for a better user experience during the test run of feature file(s).
The Workflow UI is displayed in the browser window and shows the status and logs of the servers as well as the results and request calls of the scenarios and feature files during the test run.
For more information please refer to the xref:tigerTestLibrary.adoc#_workflow_ui[Workflow UI] section in the Tiger Test library.

[#_web_ui]
=== Standalone Tiger Proxy UI (WebUI)

To watch the recorded messages and to be able to analyze issues at test run time already you can visit the Tiger Proxy web user interface at:

[source,http request]
----
http://127.0.0.1:${SERVERPORT}/webui
----

With `SERVERPORT` being the configured server port of the Tiger Proxy.

==== Bottom menu bar

The displayed buttons can trigger the following actions:

* *Routes* … allows you to modify the routes configured on this Tiger Proxy
* *Scroll Lock* … allows you to lock the scroll position. Incoming messages wills till be added to the list at the bottom of the page.
* *Toggle Button*  … has two possibilities (hide headers and hide details) which collapses either all headers (request headers as well as response headers) or all the detailed information of the requests and responses.
* *Filter*  … allows you to filter the received messages with a RbelPath or a JEXL expression. You can also search for text or a regex in this input field, but then you need to place the search text inside quotation marks (").
* *Reset* … allows you to delete all recorded messages so far. This will delete all messages on the Tiger Proxy!
* *Export* … allows you to export all or the currently filtered received messages as an HTML page or as a machine-readable tgr file.
* *Page* … allows pagination of the messages.
* *Size* … changes the size of the messages.
* *Import* … allows you to import the previously stored traffic file.
* *Quit* … allows you to quit the Tiger Proxy instance


[#_jexl_expression_detail]
=== Explanation of JEXL Expressions

In the xref:tigerTestLibrary.adoc#_workflow_ui[Workflow UI] and in the xref:_web_ui[WebUI] you can inspect the requests and response messages.
For that you can use RbelPath and/or JEXL expressions. This section should give you a brief review on the JEXL expressions.

Important to know is that an JEXL expression is usually a "condition1 operator condition2" expression which is compared.
Therefor the following operators could be used.

==== Operators

[cols="10,~"]
|===
|Operator | Description

|and \| && | cond1 __and__ cond2  and cond1 __&&__ cond2 are equivalent
|or \| \|\| | cond1 __or__ cond2  and cond1 \|\| cond2 are equivalent
|not \| ! | The ! operator can be used as well as the word __not__, e.g. !cond1 and not cond1 are equivalent
|== | Equality, e.g. cond1 == cond2

         __null__ is only ever equal to null, that means when you compare null to a non-null value, the result is false.

|!= | Inequality
|> | Greater than
|< | Less than
|>=| Greater than or equal
|<= | Less than ot equal
|=~ | In or match, can be used to check that a string matches a regular expression.
      For example "abcdef" =~ "abc.* returns true. It also checks whether any collection, set or map contains a value or not;
      in that case, it behaves as an "in" operator. "a" =~ ["a","b","c","d","e",f"] returns true.
|!~ | Not in or not-match, can be used to check that a string does not match a regular expression.
      For example "abcdef" !~ "abc.* returns false. It also checks whether any collection, set or map does not contain a value.
     "a" !~ ["a","b","c","d","e",f"] returns false.
|=^ | startsWith, for example "abcdef" =^ "abc" returns true
|!^ | startsNotWith, "abcdef" !^ "abc" returns false
|=$| endsWith, for example "abcdef" =$ "def" returns true
|!$| endsNotWith, for example "abcdef" !$ "def" returns false
|Empty| The unary empty operator behaves like the corresponding function empty().
|size| The unary size operator behaves like the corresponding function size().

==== Access on Array, Lists and Maps

To access maps in JEXL/RbelPath the point notations is used. In case of lists use the number of the list entry you want to access, starting with 0, 1, 2 and so on.

image::media/accessarray.png[width=50%,title="The access of the elements of a list is done with the number, starting with 0. For maps the point notation is used. "]

==== Access JEXL contexts

There are predefined JEXL contexts which can be used for the query, for example `isRequest`, `isResponse`, `charset`, `content` or also more
complex contexts like `response.statuscode`, `request.url`, `message.method` etc.
For more details check the InlineJexlToolbox

image::media/accessjexlcontext.png[width=50%,title="Use single quotes when using JEXL contexts with a hyphen. "]

==== More Examples

`message.headers.'content-length'.0 == "0"`  -> Use single quotes when using JEXL contexts with a hyphen.

`@.body.0.name.content =^ "Jasmin"` -> check whether the content starts with "Jasmin"

`$.body.recordId == "X12349035"`   -> checks for the recordId of a decrypted EPA-VAU-message

`$.header.Content-Type == "application/json"`  -> check if the message is a JSON-message

`request.method == "GET"` -> check if request is da GET request

`charset =~ "UTF-.*"` -> check the charset with a regex

`empty(response.url)==true` oder auch `empty(response.url)` -> url is not set

`$.body.recordId == "Y243631459" && charset == "UTF-8"` -> combines the two criterions

==== POST Form / GET parameters

When accessing parameters POST and GET are handled differently.
POST form data requests contain the data as Url encoded query string in the body of the request.
There is no easy way to decode this data generically within Rbel/JEXL.
To help you ease the situation for POST we do have a helper JEXL inline method: ```!{urlEncoded('value')}```
To access POST form data you may use ```$.body.paramname``` which will return the URL encoded value.

For GET requests you have two options:

* ```$.path.paramname``` which will return the string "paramaname=URLENCODED_VALUE" or
* ```$.path.paramname.value``` which will return the URL decoded original value.
