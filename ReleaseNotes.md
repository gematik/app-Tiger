# Changelog Tiger Test platform
# Release 3.1.4

# Bugfixes

* TGR-1455: implement conversion of POP3 AUTH command

# Release 3.1.4

## Bugfixes

* TGR-1436: Fix HTTP message pairing for old tgr-files
* TGR-1456: Only interpret POP3 RETR response as MIME

# Release 3.1.3

## Breaking Changes

* TGR-1394: Tiger-Test-Lib: the glue code
  step `TGR filter requests based on host {tigerResolvedString}` / `TGR filtere Anfragen nach Server {tigerResolvedString}`
  no longer filters the messages based on the Host http
  header.
  Instead, it refers to the hostname or the server name as defined in the tiger.yaml. E.g.:

```yaml
servers:
  anotherServer:
    hostname: example.com # here the hostname is explicitly defined as 'example.com'
    type: externalUrl
  aServer: # here there is no explicit hostname, so the server name is defined as 'aServer'
    type: externalUrl
```

  shared by multiple instances of RbelMessageValidator.
* TGR-1439: Tiger-Test-Lib: made usage of LocalProxyRbelMessageListener null safe also when the local tiger proxy is not
  active.

  ```
    <dependencyManagement>
        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
                <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>

  """

* TGR-1425: Tiger-Test-Lib: the class LocalProxyRbelMessageListener is refactored to be easier to handle in tests. If
  you are using it directly in your test suite, you need to get an instance
  with `LocalProxyRbelMessageListener.getInstance()`. The previously existing static methods are now instance methods.
  To use in unit tests you now have two options:

1. Load the full TigerTestEnvironent in your test and get the instance
   of
   the LocalProxyRbelMessageListener.

2. If you don't need a full TigerTestEnvironment you can set a test instance of the
   LocalProxyRbelMessageListener with a custom messages supplier
   with `LocalProxyRbelMessageListener.setTestInstance(new LocalProxyRbelMessageListener(new MyMessagesSupplier()))`.

## Features

* TGR-1195: UX improvements for Rbel Inspect
* TGR-1196: Workflow UI improvements (sticky sidebar, quit test run message)
* TGR-1429: Tiger-Test-Lib: it is now possible to assert if a given Json matches a specified JSON Schema. This allows
  for easier validation of JSON structures.

Example usage:

```
TGR current response at "$.body" matches as JSON_SCHEMA:
"""
{ "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "name": {
        "type": "string"
      },
      "age": {
        "type": "integer",
        "minimum": 0
      },
      "email": {
        "type": "string",
        "format": "email"
      }
    },
    "required": ["name", "age"]
  }
"""
```

For more details on how to specify a json schema refer to the external
resource https://jsoneditoronline.org/indepth/validate/json-schema-validator/ .
In https://json-schema.org/implementations#validators-web-(online) you can find a list of online validators which you
can use to prepare the schemas. In Tiger we use the **2020-12** version of the JSON Schema specification.

* TGR-1404: Tiger-Proxy: in direct reverse proxy mode the proxy opens immediately a connection to the remote target as
  soon as an incoming connection is established.

## Bugfixes

* TGR-1340: Maven: make build under Windows emit less warnings.
* TGR-1435: TigerProxy: Added support for nested Content- and Transfer-Encodings.
* TGR-1426: TigerProxy: Enable BrainPool curves again (stabilized the order of security providers)

# Release 3.0.5

## Features

* TGR-1400: RbelParser: Added support for XML-Processing Instructions.
* TGR-1406: Added the already parsed information in an Epa 3 message to the Rbel-tree.
* TGR-1408: Zion: Empty headers are no longer transmitted.
* TGR-1407: Zion: Added the possibility to delay responses for a fixed amount of time.
* TGR-1193: UX improvement in WebUi/TigerProxyLog
* TGR-1376: RbelParser: Conversion of POP3 Messages to Rbel trees

## Bugfixes

* TGR-1415: TigerProxy: Fixed a bug when multiple Tiger-Proxies would interfere with each other when selecting
  client-groups. Client-Groups can now be correctly selected, but not multiple settings in a single JVM. If that is
  desired you will have to boot the Tiger-Proxies through an external-JAR server.
* ANFEPA-2559: Rbel-Logger: Fixed the handling of the request-counter for EPA3-messages.
* TGR-1405: TigerProxy: Proxies in directReverseProxy-mode now report correct health status.
* TGR-1405: TigerProxy: More resilient re-connnect logic in mesh-setups.
* TGR-1405: TigerProxy: Fixed an issue where in a mesh-setup the order of the messages would sometimes be mixed up.

# Release 3.0.4

* Serenity BDD 4.1.10
* Cucumber 7.17.0
* RestAssured 5.4.0
* Selenium 4.18.1
* Appium 9.0.0
* Spring Boot 3.2.2
* Logback 1.4.9

## Bugfixes

* TGR-1398: Fixing reset of filter method in rbel validator glue code which caused an NPE if used in feature files (
  regression).
* TGR-1389: Fixed an issue where the RbelLogger would decrypt a VAU-EPA3-message multiple times.
* TGR-1387: Fixed an issue where in a meshed setup messages where not correctly paired.

# Release 3.0.3

## Breaking changes

* TGR-1362: HttpGlueCode now waits by default for the request to be received before continuing. This can be changed by
  setting the configuration
  key `tiger.httpClient.executeBlocking` to `false`.

## Features

* TGR-1372: Zion: The responseCode is now a string, meaning it now supports the use of TigerConfiguration values.
* TGR-1384: Tiger-Test-Lib: CBOR messages can now also be asserted using JSON
  structures (`And TGR current response at "$.body" matches as JSON:`)
* TGR-1377: Tiger-Test-Lib:
    * Added Request Validation Steps:
        * @Then("TGR current request body matches:")
        * @Then("TGR current request with attribute {tigerResolvedString} matches {tigerResolvedString}")
        * @Then("TGR current request contains node {tigerResolvedString}")
        * @Then("TGR current request at {tigerResolvedString} matches:")
        * @Then("TGR current request at {tigerResolvedString} matches as {modeType}:")
        * @Then("TGR current request with attribute {tigerResolvedString} does not match {tigerResolvedString}")
    * Updated user manual, see section "Tiger Test Lib > Validating requests"

## Bugfixes

* TGR-1373: Fixed an issue where in a meshed setup the sender and receiver addresses were switched in the receiving
  tiger proxy.
* TGR-1381: Tiger-Proxy: Use the correct length for IV and AD in AES-GCM decryption.

# Release 3.0.2

## Breaking changes

* TCLE-7: if you use the tiger-cloud-extension you need to update it to version 1.10.0 due to changes in organisation of
  some configuration classes. The new tiger-cloud-extension version adds support for copying files into the docker
  container created by the server
  type `docker`. You can copy the files by adding the following configuration to the `dockerOptions`:

```yaml
copyFiles:
  - sourcePath: ./example/path/file_to_copy.txt
    destinationPath: /path/in/container/file_to_copy.txt
    fileMode: 0633
``` 

## Bugfixes

* TGR-1174: when a content-type header is set in a request made with the tiger http client, the charset is no longer
  automatically appended. If no content-type header is set and `activateRbelWriter = true` the content type and charset
  are automatically generated.
* TGR-1342: Zion can now handle root arrays in JSON responses.
* TGR-1318: Byte-Arrays can now be stored and changed in TigerGlobalConfiguration
* TGR-327: Reasonphrase is no longer added implicitly in the TigerProxy (when the phrase is empty from the server it
  will stay empty)
* TGR-1314: Tiger-Proxy: The content-length headers are no longer removed from the responses logged.
* TGR-1334: fixed issue where responses were not correctly paired with the requests in the workflow ui.
* TGR-1194: Usability improvements for the configuration editor.
* TGR-1172: fixed issue where messages coming from a remote tiger proxy would display the timestamp in a different
  timezone.
* TGR-1330: fixed issue where messages coming from a remote tiger proxy on a meshed setup would have the sender and
  receiver addresses switched.

## Features

* TGR-1313: Added support for the new VAU 'Epa f√ºr alle' format (VauEpa3).
* TGR-1286: Tiger-Proxy: The number of open connections is now tracked and can be queried.
* TGR-1210: Tiger-Proxy: Connection problems to remote servers are now logged.
* TGR-1351: Tiger-Proxy: Competing routes are now supported. The proxy automatically selects the most specific route if
  multiple routes are matching.
* TGR-1353: You can set a defined port to be used for the WorkflowUI using the configuration
  key `tiger.lib.workflowUiPort`.
* TGR-1315:
  step ```TGR send {requestType} request to {tigerResolvedUrl} with contentType {string} and multiline body:``` added
* TGR-1320: TLS-Facets now also carry the TLS-Protocol and the Cipher-Suite used for the connection
* TGR-1319: New Gluecode added for starting & stopping servers:

```
    Given TGR stop server "remoteTigerProxy"
    And TGR start server "remoteTigerProxy"
```

* TGR-1325: Tiger-Proxy: Added new 'criterion' option for routes. This allows to match requests based on their content:

```yaml
tigerProxy:
  proxyRoutes:
    - from: /
      to: http://orf.at/blub/
      criterions:
        - $.header.foo == 'bar'
```

* TGR-1321: The variable set by the glue code
  step ```TGR set local variable {tigerResolvedString} to {tigerResolvedString}``` now gets automatically cleared after
  the test case run is finished. The new glue code
  step ```TGR set local feature variable {tigerResolvedString} to {tigerResolvedString}``` sets a variable that is
  cleared after the execution of the feature file is finished.
* TGR-1331: remove no longer necessary dependency tools checker.
* TGR-1238: refactored uses of Stream.peek().

* Serenity BDD 4.1.0
* Cucumber 7.15.0
* RestAssured 5.4.0
* Selenium 4.16.1
* Appium 9.0.0
* Spring Boot 3.2.2
* Logback 1.4.9

## Features

* TGR-1241: Added Case-Insensitive matching in RbelPath-Expressions: `$.body.[~'bar']`
* TGR-1309: CBOR added to Rbel
* TGR-1298: Updated frontend libraries.
* TGR-1310: migrated frontend build tool from vue-cli to vite.

## Bugfixes

* TGR-1306: Zion: When `bodyFile` references a non-existent file, the server now will not start and give a meaningful
  exception.
* TGR-1308: Server-sided certificates with Brainpool-curves are now supported again.
* TGR-1301: fixed an issue where clicking on a message in the traffic visualization diagram did not always open the
  Rbel-Log details pane and scrolled to the corresponding message.
* TGR-1312: fixed an issue where the execution pane would not render correctly.

# Release 3.0.0

* RestAssured 5.4.0
* Selenium 4.16.1
* Appium 9.0.0
* Spring Boot 3.2.2
* Logback 1.4.9

## Breaking changes

* TGR-1270: The order of messages in the TigerProxy is now chronologically. So pairs (request/response) no longer
  appear next to each other. In the RbelFlow a new icon has been added linking to a potential partner-message.
* TGR-1270: Messages are now parsed asynchronously. The order of the messages in the TigerProxy is the order of the
  messages as they were received. This asynchronous parsing means that messages are added to the TigerProxy before they
  are completely parsed. To minimize confusion the following changes were made:
    * 'getRbelMessagesList()' now only contains the messages up until the first non-parsed message. This means that the
      list might not be complete anymore. The RBelValidatorGlue-steps are prepared (They use a timeout to look for the
      requested message) and should not be affected.
    * 'getRbelMessages()' contains all messages, including the non-parsed ones. To minimize confusion the '
      .getLast()', '.getFirst()', '.peekLast()' and '.peekFirst()' methods now wait until the parsing of the requested
      message is finished. The Iterator ('for(RbelElement msg : tigerProxy.getRbelMessages())') will also wait for the
      requested message to be parsed.
* TGR-1264: Lombok packages no longer are provided to depending test suites. Given best practices and to avoid
  dependency issues in test suites you are enforced to depend on your own version of lombok IF you need it from this
  version on.
* TGR-1276: Ordering of XML-Nodes has changed (now attributes always come first, then child nodes).
* TGR-650: the configuration key `tigerProxyCfg` is renamed in `tigerProxyConfiguration`. You need to update your
  configuration yamls if you use this key.

## Features

* TGR-898: Tiger-Proxy now no longer depends on mockserver, which has been internalized and stripped down.
* TGR-1012: clicking a message in the traffic visualization diagram opens the Rbel Log Details pane and scrolls to the
  corresponding message.
* TGR-1245: Traffic-Logging added to Tiger-Proxy. Can be turned off via configuration key
  ```tiger.tigerProxy.activateTrafficLogging: false```
* TGR-1257: Traffic Visualization feature is documented in user manual.
* TGR-1273: Added support for local port identification of zion servers so that they can be correctly displayed in the
  sequence diagrams.
* TGR-1086: replace OS specific commands with OSHI library for finding ports being used by external jars.
* TGR-1292: Tiger-Proxy now supports OCSP-stapling. To enable it, set the configuration key
  ```tiger.tigerProxy.tls.ocspSigner: myOcspSigner.p12;password``` to the path of the OCSP-signer certificate to be used
  when generating the OCSP responses.
* TGR-1282: Traffic Visualization feature no longer experimental. Can be turned on via the configuration:

```yaml
lib:
  trafficVisualization: true
```

## Bugfixes

* TGR-949: Tiger-Proxy only adds trailing slashes to requests if the request explicitly demands it.
* TGR-938: XML-Messages with UTF-8 content can now be transmitted without alteration.
* TGR-1254: RbelPath-Expressions with a selector and a qualification immediately after (e.g. $..foo[?(content=='bar')])
  are now correctly parsed.
* TGR-1266: Invalid configurations for servers are not reported in console or workflow UI but abort the test env mgr
  silently.
* TGR-1304: Loop-Statements in Zion definitions are now correctly resolved.
* TGR-1276: The RbelWriter now correctly serializes XML-Namespaces.
* TGR-1262: Step "TGR pause test run execution with message {string}" and step "TGR pause test run execution
  with message {tigerResolvedString} and message in case of error {tigerResolvedString}" will now correctly
  be distinguished

# Release 2.3.2

## Breaking changes

* TGR-1173 removed the long deprecated step ```TGR current response at {string} matches {string}```. Replace it with the
  step ```TGR current response with attribute {tigerResolvedString} matches {tigerResolvedString}```.

## Bugfixes

* TGR-1173: refactorings all over the code (more than 500 sonarqube issues) to increase code maintainability
* TGR-1177: Empty fallback values can now be correctly resolved (to an empty string)
* TGR-1229: Added fallback for RbelPaths in JEXL-expressions that yield no results
* TGR-1242: JEXL-expressions that contain RbelPaths that terminate in a star (*) are now working again correctly
* TGR-1231: TigerProxy: The timestamps on messages are no longer wrong if asynchronous parsing is enabled

## Features

* TGR-1096: it is now possible to replay a test scenario from the Workflow UI.
* TGR-1040: we can now observe the traffic in a sequence diagram. This is an experimental feature that needs to be
  activated in the configuration with:

```yaml
lib:
  experimental:
    trafficVisualization: true
```

In unix systems the tool 'lsof' is required to be installed in the system.

# Release 2.3.1

## Bugfixes

* TGR-1125: Tiger-Zion: Fixed assignment-bugs
* TGR-1183: fixed an issue where TigerConfigurationKeys were wrongly ignoring parts of the key when they had a repeated
  subkey.
* TGR-1186: Fixed healthcheck-issues with TLS servers
* TGR-1201: Fixes unresolved environment variables in TigerConfig
* TGR-1180: fixed position of close button in the configuration editor in the WorkflowUi
* TGR-1143: in case of missing dependencies for a server type the exception is more clearly stating that there is a
  dependency missing
* TGR-1190: fixed an issue where when setting fallbacks ( e.g.: ${foo.bar|orThisValue} ) the fallback value would always
  be used also when the value to resolve was existing in the JexlContext.

# Features

* TGR-608: All Tiger core BDD steps are now implicitly using Variable/JEXL resolution on its parameters. So you now may
  use string values for any parameters containing TigerGlobalConfiguration references such as ```${tiger.myprop}``` and
  JEXL expressions like ```"!{resolve(file('testfile.json'))}"``` and they will be resolved by implicit magic. All Tiger
  extensions will be migrating to this automatic resolution with the next version.
* TGR-1214: Tiger Proxy tests are now run in 10 separate forks, this will put your machine under heavy load and requires
  at least 32 GB to run. On Linux using ```nice mvn verify``` may be a good idea

# Release 2.3.0

## Features

* TGR-912: Healthchecks for externalUrl-Servers now honor the configured forwardProxyInfo of the localTigerProxy

  e.g. `${myMap..[?(@.target=='schmoo')].target}`
* TGR-1163: TigerProxy: The groups to be used for the TLS-Handshakes can now be set for client
* TGR-899: Migrated FAQ.md to FAQ.adoc, translated to english

## Bugfixes

* TGR-1150: TigerProxy WebUI: Correct escaping in inspect-dialog for RbelPath-generation added
* TGR-1038: Changed assertThatNo()-exceptions to assertThatNo.isThrownBy so the tests are not ignored
* TGR-1170: TigerGlobalConfiguration: Fixes for very rare race conditions leading to ConcurrentModification-Exceptions
* TGR-1162: fixed an issue were the amount of test cases was not reported correctly by serenity.

## Features

* TGR-1022: Introduce a new httpbin server type. See User Manual section "Tiger test environment manager > Supported
  server nodes and their configuration"
* TGR-1032: With "activateLogs: false" in externalJarOptions for servers the logs are not sent to the workflow UI

  the execution of a test suite.
* TGR-567: Tiger Proxy UI - when downloading traffic data, it is now possible to download only the data of the current
  applied filter.
* TGR-1047: Finalising Playwight tests

## Bugfixes

* TGR-1048: Resolved the problems with steps not being found in IntelliJ's Gherkin plugin. Also they were executed, one
  was not able to look them up with auto complete and if entered manually the step was marked as undefined
* TGR-1045: With "activateLogs: false" in externalJarOptions for servers deactivates the logs completely, with "
  activateWorkflowLogs: false" deactivates sending logs to the workflow UI only
* TGR-1057: modified the test httpclientenv.yaml so that it uses the new server type httpbin instead of winstone.
* TGR-1058: RbelPath in the Inspect modal on selected element fixed
* TGR-623: Tiger Proxy UI - when importing a .tgr traffic file, the previously displayed traffic is removed.
* TGR-1074: Scenario Outlines counter fixed
* TGR-873: Tiger Proxy UI - when the connection with the backend is lost a visible error dialog is shown in the UI to
  inform the user.

# Release 2.1.3

## Breaking changes

* with TGR-1015 we fixed the http client steps sending form data (GET/POST) to be not URL encoded.
    * The affected steps are:
        * @When("TGR send {requestType} request to {string} with:")
        * @When("TGR eine {requestType} Anfrage an {string} mit den folgenden Daten sendet:")
        * @Then("TGR sende eine {requestType} Anfrage an {string} mit folgenden Daten:")
    * and
        * @When("TGR send {requestType} request to {string} without waiting for the response with:")
        * @Then("TGR sende eine {requestType} Anfrage an {string} ohne auf Antwort zu warten mit folgenden Daten:")
    * Please be aware that validation of the params needs to be handled differently now.
        * For GET requests you can validate the value of the get request via: $.path.paramname.value which returns the
          URL decoded value
        * For POST requests the value is URL encoded in the body, so we can not easily validate it ULR decoded.
          $.body.paramname will therefore contain the URL encoded value. To ease with validation we have introduced a
          new JEXL helper function !{rbel:urlEncocded('value')} which will return the URL encoded value of the given
          string.

## Bugfixes

* Wildcard file filters are now also supported for windows users
* TGR-956: Fixed a bug for correctly handling concurrent requests in Zion
* TGR-979: Fixed bug that failed BDD tests in tiger-test-lib were ignored and the build was labelled green. Workaround
  was to disable the serenity maven plugin in tiger-test-utils
* TGRFHIR-8: URL-Query parameters are no longer twice URL-encoded when using HTTP Glue Code
* TGR-999: Fixed scenario outlines trigger displaying all subsequent scenarios with data variant counters in titles of
  workflow UI
* TGR-1015: Datatable based param/values of http client GET and POST request steps are now URL encoded per default.

## Features

* TGR-976: Zion-assignments can now contain any string (including Configuration-Placeholders, JEXL-expression and any
  combination thereof)
* TGR-976: New annotation `@TigerSkipEvaluation` which skips the evaluation of configuration values.
* TGR-1010: Added Http client step to send a request with a multiline body (for more complex json requests)
* TGR-1015: To ease with validation of POST form parameters, we have introduced a new JEXL helper function !
  {urlEncocded('value')} which will return the URL encoded value of the given string.
* TGR-977: Zion can now match path variables and assigns them to the values given in the request URL. See User Manual
  section "Tiger Zion > Matching path variables"
* TGR-1020: added http client step to clear all default headers.
    * @When("TGR clear all default headers")
    * @When("TGR l√∂sche alle default headers")
* TGR-1024: added http client step to allow to specify multiple default headers via key value pairs as doc string
    * @When("TGR set default headers:")
    * @Then("TGR setze folgende default headers:")
    * @When("TGR folgende default headers gesetzt werden:")
* TGR-1027: Extend tiger glue code and inline jexl to enable eRp Migration
    * new step to print out the value of a stored variable
        * @Dann("TGR gebe variable {string} aus")
        * @Then("TGR print variable {string}")
    * new inline jexl methods:
        * resolve(string) -> string : resolves all placeholders and jexl expression in string. Very useful in
          combination with the file() method
        * randomHex(int size) -> string : produces a random hex string with size characters
        * currentLocalDate() -> string : produces a string of format YYYY-MM-DD of today

* Logback 1.4.7

# Release 2.0.1

## Breaking changes

* TGR-924: German BDD steps to set local and global variables were grammatically incorrect and have been fixed. So "TGR
  setze lokale/globale Variable {string} auf {string} setzen" has been changed to "TGR setze lokale/globale Variable
  {string} auf {string}"
* TGR-909: all **Gherkin / Feature parser code has been removed** from Tiger as Polarion Toolbox (its only usage) has
  been refactored to use the Cucumber internal Gherkin parser. If you based your code on the self written parser, check
  POTO to see how to replace the parsing code in
  the ```polarion-toolbox-client/src/main/java/de/gematik/polarion/toolbox/worker/FeatureFileParser.java``` source file.
* TGR-864: The order of parameters for the "TGR send {} request to {} with body {}" has been changed (body now comes as
  the final parameter). This is done to ensure consistency across languages and to always relegate the potentially
  longest parameter to the last place, improving readability.
* Removed Tiger Admin-UI (Insufficient users)
* TGR-931: For externalJar-Servers that use local-jars: The actual path now starts immediately after the colon.
  While `local://blub.jar` was a working solution as well before, now only `local:blub.jar` is accepted (the slashes
  were discarded before, now everything after the colon is taken the path).
* TGR-948: Changed the behavior for trailing slashes in tiger proxy routes: When either the target-path or the
  request-path end in a slash, a slash will be added to the resulting request. This implicitly fixes a bug that lead to
  doubled slashes in some resulting requests. Caveat: When the request is for a nested target the trailing slash will
  only be added if it was present in the actual request (as the route-target references another entity in this case)

## Bugfixes

* TGR-911: Since 2.0.0 the rbel log files included font awesome v5.4 whereas tiger proxy generated HTML including font
  awesome 6.4. This caused icons to be not displayed or being displayed as invalid icons.
* TGR-922: Waiting for non-paired messages now works correctly
* TGR-841: Non-XML parts in MTOM-Messages are now converted correctly. They are stored in conjunction with their
  respective XPath-Locations. A sample tree is shown here:

```
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄbody (------=_Part_2_1927395369.1677073618377\r\nContent...) (RbelMtomFacet)

```

***** TGR-651: Sender (Client) addresses for messages are now again included in parsed messages of the Tiger Proxy.

## Features

* TGR-920: Non-Blocking mode added for the TGR http steps
* TGR-934: RbelPath-Expressions are now trimmed before parsing. If you have spaces in keys, escape them like
  so: `$.body.['foo bar'].key`
* Custom logos can now be defined for your RBel-Logs. Please use the configuration key "tiger.lib.rbelLogoFilePath" to
  specify a PNG
  file to be used in your logs.
* TGR-931: Local jar-Files can now be found (via the `source`-attribute) relative to the working directory. Wildcards
  are also supported now. So a source-attribute of `../target/app-*.jar` can now be used.
* TGR-950: To find alternating values, concatenate them using the pipe symbols, like so:
  `$.body.['foo'|'bar'].key`
* TGR-869: When multiple properties in either System-Properties or Environment-Variables map to the same value and
  differ in value the startup will
  be aborted with an exception pointing to the conflicting values. This is done to follow the "fail fast" philosophy and
  give the user the chance
  to resolve the conflict instead of choosing an arbitrary value automatically.

* TGR-888: ${hostname} added as a configuration property
* TGR-890: Workflow Ui now has a quit button in the left sidebar to abort the currently active test execution
* TGR-890: Workflow Ui now has a pause button in the left sidebar to pause test execution. Please be aware that
  timeouts (e.g. while waiting for a rbel message to appear are not affected by the pause mode, thus using pause on
  these steps will cause a timeout and potentially subsequent test failure).
* TGR-901: New server-type "zion" added. Supports adding and configuring zion-Servers directly in a tiger.yaml
* TGR-730: support changing log level similar to spring boot by specifying package or class name and level in tiger.yaml
  under logging.level

```yaml
servers:
  server1:
    ......
logging:
  level:
    de.gematik.test.tiger.testenvmgr.TigerTestEnvMgr: TRACE
    de.gematik.test.tiger.lib.TigerDirector: TRACE
    de.gematik.test.tiger.proxy: TRACE
    localTigerProxy: TRACE
```

## Breaking changes

* tiger-<hostname>.yaml is now read additionally to the tiger.yaml, no longer instead of! Migration should be seamless
  unless you have both a tiger- and a tiger-<hostname>.yaml. In that case manual migration of the properties is
  required, depending on whether you want them as a default on all machines (tiger.yaml) or simply as a host-specific
  configuration (tiger-<hostname>.yaml).

TGR-714: docker, docker compose server types have been merged with helm chart support into the tiger-cloud-extension a
separate project to be published together with this release. **So to keep using docker functionality within tiger make
sure to add the additional dependency to your project.** If you don't use docker or helm chart you should not be
affected at all.

* TGR-817: major rewrite of Tiger Serenity integration. We now more closely are integrated with Serenity, fixing bugs
  like cucumber tag filter property not always being respected, using multiple examples (with Annotations) causes the
  Workflow UI to show wrong data in the test execution pane. When using the tiger-maven-plugin to generate your test
  driver classes no modification to your code is necessary. Else, please note that:
    * the package of the TigerCucumberRunner class has been changed
    * the TigerCucumberListener is now automatically added in standalone and mvn context, so remove it from your plugins
      cucumber options.

# Release 0.19.1

## Bugfix

* Fixing module with incomplete -sources and -javadoc JAR files

-------

# Release 0.19.0

## Breaking Change

* TGR-113: Test-Context, Test-Config and Test-Variables are deprecated. All values are now stored
  using `TigerGlobalConfiguration`. This supersedes all uses of domains and context, of which there are no known
  instances. If your migration is difficult, please contact the team.
* The migration entails a complete rethink of configuration and value-stores in tiger. If you have any troubles please
  read the user-manual (Chapter 6) and don't hesitate to ask us.
* TGR-299: The configuration flag `proxyProtocol` from the server-type tigerProxy has been renamed
  to `proxiedServerProtocol` to clarify usage and avoid confusion.
* If a `proxiedServer` did have a Healthcheck-URL (or source-URL for `externalUrlServer`) previously the reverse-proxy
  would target the deep-path. Now it will target the domain only.
* TGR-197: PKIIdentities must not any longer be specified using Windows specific paths. Please use linux "/" folder
  separator character and relative paths to ensure cross-platform support of your test environments.

## Bugfix

* TGR-350: Multiple Scenariooutlines in feature file break test execution.
* RBEL-41: Too restrictive validation of hostnames in RbelHostname element

* TGR-113: Configuration has been refactored/simplified and all placeholders in tiger-servers are now successfully
  resolved.
* TGR-332: Tiger proxies are no longer instantiated as external Jar downloaded from maven central but are started in
  process. This dramatically reduces startup time and reduces bandwidth demands.
* TGR-341: Upgrade to Serenity BDD v3.1.16 and thus Selenium 4

-------

# Release 0.18.1

## Bugfix

* Tiger admin UI allow to rename nodes to ""

-------

# Release 0.18.0

## Breaking Change

* TGR-113: Major rework in TigerConfiguration. The Blackbox behavior is unchanged in all known cases. However the API
  changed a lot! TigerConfigurationHelper was deleted.
* If you want to read configuration files please use `TigerGlobalConfiguration` (in cases where you want to use the
  global configuration store) or instantiate a new `TigerConfigurationLoader` (in cases where you only need the
  configuration functionality and not the actual global configuration).
* The serialization/deserialization Utils from TigerConfigurationHelper please refer to TigerSerializationUtil (
  JSON/YAML conversion).

## Bugfix

* TGR-288: Make snakeyaml/jackson work with default values in Configuration object

  separated list of servers that need to be started prior to the given server. Please review & change all testenv.ymls
  accordingly.
* TGR-193:
    * PKI Keys' type have been changed from "cert / key" to "Certificate / Key"
    * disableRbelParsing attribute has been renamed to activateRbelParsing with default value true

## √Ñnderungen

* **BREAKING** TGR-87 Die Serverliste im tiger-testenv.yml wurde angepasst. Das Attribut 'name' wurde entfernt und durch
  das optionale Attribut 'hostname' ersetzt. Sollte 'hostname' nicht definiert werden, wird es auf den Keywert des
  Mapeintrages gesetzt. Diese √Ñnderung bedeutet, dass zwar der Hostname bei mehreren Servereintr√§gen identisch sein
  kann, allerdings muss der Keywert **eindeutig** sein. Details zu der Migration befinden sich weiter unten.

## Entfernt

* TGR-173 Die Ausgabe der Testschritte erfolgt nun nicht mehr √ºber Tiger, sondern kann
  im [serenity.properties](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/theserenitybook/latest/serenity-system-properties.html)  
  √ºber serenity.logging=VERBOSE aktiviert werden.
