# Changelog Tiger Testplattform

-------
* **Serenity BDD 3.6.20**
* Cucumber 7.11.0
* RestAssured 5.2.0
* Selenium 4.8.0
* Appium 8.3.0
* Spring Boot 2.7.5
* Logback 1.2.11

# Release 2.0.0

## Bugfixes

* TGR-769 Serenity reports show examples now with a collapse icon clearly indicating whether its folded or unfolded
* TGR-893: Saving of HTML-Traffic in Webui refactored, HTML rendering has moved from frontend to backend

## Features

* Upgraded Serenity BDD to latest 3.6.20
* Added first version of FAQ.md
* TGR-867: ExternalUrl server uses source URL as default health check URL if not set
* TGR-872: Added glue code to wait for non-paired messages (optional excluding existing messages)
* TGR-888: ${hostname} added as a configuration property
* TGR-890: Workflow Ui now has a quit button in the left sidebar to abort the currently active test execution
* TGR-890: Workflow Ui now has a pause button in the left sidebar to pause test execution. Please be aware that timeouts (e.g. while waiting for a rbel message to appear are not affected by the pause mode, thus using pause on these steps will cause a timeout and potentially subsequent test failure).

## Breaking changes

* tiger-<hostname>.yaml is now read additionally to the tiger.yaml, no longer instead of! Migration should be seamless unless you have both a tiger- and a tiger-<hostname>.yaml. In that case manual migration of the properties is required, depending on whether you want them as a default on all machines (tiger.yaml) or simply as a host-specific configuration (tiger-<hostname>.yaml).

## Breaking changes

TGR-714: docker, docker compose server types have been merged with helm chart support into the tiger-cloud-extension a separate project to be published together with this release. **So to keep using docker functionality within tiger make sure to add the additional dependency to your project.** If you don't use docker or helm chart you should not be affected at all.

* TGR-817: major rewrite of Tiger Serenity integration. We now more closely are integrated with Serenity, fixing bugs like cucumber tag filter property not always being respected, using multiple examples (with Annotations) causes the Workflow UI to show wrong data in the test execution pane. When using the tiger-maven-plugin to generate your test driver classes no modification to your code is necessary. Else, please note that:
  * the package of the TigerCucumberRunner class has been changed
  * the TigerCucumberListener is now automatically added in standalone and mvn context, so remove it from your plugins cucumber options.

-------
# Release 0.19.1

## Bugfix

* Fixing module with incomplete -sources and -javadoc JAR files

-------
# Release 0.19.0

## Breaking Change

* TGR-113: Test-Context, Test-Config and Test-Variables are deprecated. All values are now stored
  using `TigerGlobalConfiguration`. This supersedes all uses of domains and context, of which there are no known
  instances. If your migration is difficult, please contact the team.
* The migration entails a complete rethink of configuration and value-stores in tiger. If you have any troubles please
  read the user-manual (Chapter 6) and don't hesitate to ask us.
* TGR-299: The configuration flag `proxyProtocol` from the server-type tigerProxy has been renamed
  to `proxiedServerProtocol` to clarify usage and avoid confusion.
* If a `proxiedServer` did have a Healthcheck-URL (or source-URL for `externalUrlServer`) previously the reverse-proxy
  would target the deep-path. Now it will target the domain only.
* TGR-197: PKIIdentities must not any longer be specified using Windows specific paths. Please use linux "/" folder
  separator character and relative paths to ensure cross-platform support of your test environments.

## Bugfix

* TGR-350: Multiple Scenariooutlines in feature file break test execution.

* TGR-113: Configuration has been refactored/simplified and all placeholders in tiger-servers are now successfully
  resolved.
* TGR-332: Tiger proxies are no longer instantiated as external Jar downloaded from maven central but are started in
  process. This dramatically reduces startup time and reduces bandwidth demands.
* TGR-341: Upgrade to Serenity BDD v3.1.16 and thus Selenium 4

-------
# Release 0.18.1

## Bugfix

* Tiger admin UI allow to rename nodes to ""

## Features

* TGR-50: Tiger test environment configuration now has an admin Web UI. Check out the tiger-admin module
* TGR-306: Tiger admin UI now has "Duplicate node" feature

-------
# Release 0.18.0

## Breaking Change

* TGR-113: Major rework in TigerConfiguration. The Blackbox behavior is unchanged in all known cases. However the API
  changed a lot! TigerConfigurationHelper was deleted.
* If you want to read configuration files please use `TigerGlobalConfiguration` (in cases where you want to use the
  global configuration store) or instantiate a new `TigerConfigurationLoader` (in cases where you only need the
  configuration functionality and not the actual global configuration).

## Ãnderungen

* **BREAKING** TGR-87 Die Serverliste im tiger-testenv.yml wurde angepasst. Das Attribut 'name' wurde entfernt und durch
  das optionale Attribut 'hostname' ersetzt. Sollte 'hostname' nicht definiert werden, wird es auf den Keywert des
  Mapeintrages gesetzt. Diese Ãnderung bedeutet, dass zwar der Hostname bei mehreren ServereintrÃ¤gen identisch sein
  kann, allerdings muss der Keywert **eindeutig** sein. Details zu der Migration befinden sich weiter unten.

## Entfernt

* TGR-173 Die Ausgabe der Testschritte erfolgt nun nicht mehr Ã¼ber Tiger, sondern kann
  im [serenity.properties](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/theserenitybook/latest/serenity-system-properties.html)  
  Ã¼ber serenity.logging=VERBOSE aktiviert werden.
