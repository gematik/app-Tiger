# For example, to allow access from your local networks, you may uncomment the
# following rule (and/or add rules that match your definition of "local"):
http_access allow localnet

# And finally deny all other access to this proxy
#http_access deny all
# Usually we would deny all and only allow traffic to specific ports. But since we are using random ports in the unit
#test we would end up blocking the tests. This rule must be here at the end, so that we only allow if the previous "allow authentication" has not denied access
http_access allow all
